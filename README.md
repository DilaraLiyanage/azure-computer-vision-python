# ðŸ§  Azure Computer Vision Project

This project demonstrates how to use the **Azure Computer Vision API** with **Python** to analyze images and extract meaningful insights. It features modular input via **JSON**, robust error handling, and clean integration with Azure services.

This project was built as part of a **Coursera course** and reflects the **practical application** of cloud-based computer vision.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ComputerVisionProject.git
cd ComputerVisionProject
```
### **2. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### **3. Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a ```.env``` file in the root directory and add your Azure credentials:

```env
ENDPOINT=https://your-endpoint.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=your_subscription_key
```

### **4. Prepare Your Input**
Edit the ```image.json``` file to include the image URLs or local paths you want to analyze:

```json
{
  "images": [
    "https://example.com/image1.jpg",
    "https://example.com/image2.png"
  ]
}
```
### **5. Run the Script**
```bash
python vision_test.py
```

The script will analyze the images and display results such as:

- Image descriptions
- Tags and labels
- Objects detected
- Faces detected
- Color schemes and dominant colors
- Text extraction (OCR)

## ðŸ§ª Requirements
The project uses the following Python packages:
```ini
azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision==0.7.0  
msrest==0.6.21  
requests==2.31.0  
python-dotenv==1.0.0  # Optional: Only needed if using a .env file for credentials
```

To install them manually:
```bash
pip install azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision msrest requests
```

If you're using a .env file to manage your API keys or environment variables, include:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```
